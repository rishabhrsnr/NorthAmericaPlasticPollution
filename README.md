# Project Title: Predicting Plastic Pollution Patterns in North America

## Overview
This repository contains the results of a comprehensive study aimed at understanding and predicting plastic pollution patterns in North America using the Break Free from Plastic dataset. 
This project was undertaken as part of my coursework for ALY6080: Integrated Experiential Learning.

## Objectives
- To conduct an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and associations in plastic pollution across North America.
- To develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to forecast material types of plastic waste.
- To create an interactive dashboard to visualize data insights effectively.

## Key Findings
- Identified a positive correlation between GDP and population levels with the types and quantities of plastic pollution.
- Developed multiple predictive models, with the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model showing the highest accuracy at 45.37% in forecasting plastic material types based on demographic and economic parameters.

## Project Components
- `Final_Report.docx`: The complete project report detailing the methodology, analysis, results, and recommendations.
- `Data/`: Directory containing the dataset used in the study.
- `Scripts/`: R scripts for performing the exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling.
- `Dashboard/`: Files and resources used to build the interactive dashboard for visualizing the study results.

## Running the Scripts
- Make sure R is installed along with the necessary packages (`randomForest`, `e1071`, `gbm`).
- Execute the scripts in the `Scripts/` directory to reproduce the analysis and model predictions.

## Dependencies
- R and the following R packages: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `shiny`, `randomForest`, `e1071`, `gbm`
